# JPA Playground

This project is for devs to play around with JPA concepts without having to use a Spring Boot Controller.

All main()-type functionality should be in the `tests` package. No Controllers are necessary to run the JPA code. The JPA code runs as unit tests. Look at AuthorBookTests.java for a model.
